# CryptoClustering
This activity takes a look at supervised machine learning using the KMeans model. It follows these steps: 

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

Answer the following question:
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
